  ## Why did I build this?
  
  This was a project I worked on for 4 days, demonstrating my ability to build a functional web application.
  I learnt a lot along the way, and over all it was a lot of fun to make.
  
  ## What is this? 
  
  This is a fun little game, called 'True or False'. The user must read a factoid and determine if it is true or false.
  The user can create an account, and then use 'FactoidStudio' to create/read/update/delete their own factoids. These are then added to the random selection.
  
  ## How to play
